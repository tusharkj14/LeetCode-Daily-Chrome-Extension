## Extension File
To run the Extension on your Chrome, just clone the repository, use command `ng build` and then open `chrome::extensions` on  chrome and turn on developer modes. Then load the dist/leet-code-extension folder onto the load unpacked option and use it.
Or just wait till I publish it on the Chrome Webstore.
